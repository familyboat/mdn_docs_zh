## Media

- [Audio and video manipulation](/en-US/docs/Web/Media/Audio_and_video_manipulation)
  - : The beauty of the web is that you can combine technologies to create new forms. Having native audio and video in the browser means we can use these data streams with technologies such as {{htmlelement("canvas")}}, [WebGL](/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebGL_API) or [Web Audio API](/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Audio_API) to modify audio and video directly, for example adding reverb/compression effects to audio, or grayscale/sepia filters to video. This article provides a reference to explain what you need to do.

## APIs

- [Using FormData objects](/en-US/docs/Web/API/XMLHttpRequest_API/Using_FormData_Objects)
  - : The [`FormData`](/en-US/docs/Web/API/FormData) object lets you compile a set of key/value pairs to send using {{domxref("Window/fetch", "fetch()")}}. It's primarily intended for sending form data, but can be used independently of forms to transmit keyed data. The transmission is in the same format that the form's `submit()` method would use to send the data if the form's encoding type were set to "multipart/form-data".
- [Progressive web apps](/en-US/docs/Web/Progressive_web_apps#core_pwa_guides)
  - : Progressive web apps (PWAs) use modern web APIs along with traditional progressive enhancement strategy to create cross-platform web applications.
